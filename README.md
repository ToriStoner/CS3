# Case Study 

## This repository contains the dataset, the case study, deliverable instructions, code, and reference materials necessary to complete this project. 

## Important Documents 

### Case Study Rubric:
#### Provides the requirements for the deliverable, where to submit the deliverables, and how to meet expectations. 

### CS3 Motivation and Deliverable:
#### Provides an overview of the case study and why it is important. This document also provides information about the deliverable. 

## Data
### Both the entire dataset and the cleaned dataset are included in the data folder. The data is to large to include in github, so links to google drive are included. 

## Code
### The code folder includes code used in the initial project. Scripts include EDA, SARIMA and ARIMA analysis and the code used to create the Random Forest predictive model. Scripts also include outputs in the form of tables, graphs, and other visualizations. 

## Reference Materials 
### This folder includes background information on the topic: crime trends in Los Angeles. It also includes links that provide technical background on how to use ARIMA and SARIMA models and the distinction between the two.
